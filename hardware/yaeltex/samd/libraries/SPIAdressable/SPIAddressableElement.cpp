SPIAddressableElement::SPIAddressableElement() {}

/*! The begin function takes three parameters.  The first is an SPI class
 *  pointer.  This is the address of an SPI object (either the default
 *  SPI object on the Arduino, or an object made using the DSPIx classes
 *  on the chipKIT).  The second parameter is the chip select pin number
 *  to use when communicating with the chip.  The third is the internal
 *  address number of the chip.  This is controlled by the three Ax pins
 *  on the chip.
 *  It also performs the initial configuration of the IO expander chip.
 *  Not only does it set up the SPI communications, but it also configures the chip
 *  for address-based communication and sets the default parameters and registers
 *  to sensible values.
 *
 *  Example:
 *
 *      myModule.begin(&SPIBUS, 0);
